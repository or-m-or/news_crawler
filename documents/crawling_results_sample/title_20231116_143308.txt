Although much of the close-up photography by amateurs is outdoors, it often requires flash lighting to fill in shadows on insects or reveal the texture of flowers. Most flashes, however, are made for picture-taking at more conventional distances.
The R1 Wireless Close-Up Speedlight System from Nikon (www.nikonusa.com) includes two tiny flash units, a control module and various adaptors -- all compatible with the flash control system in the company's current single-lens-reflex digital cameras as well as the F6 film camera.
Lindsay Silverman, a senior technical manager at Nikon's United States division, said the system's main attraction was the wireless connection between the camera and the flashes. That eliminates cords that can cast shadows or intrude into close-ups as well as making it easier to position lights in tight spots.
The kit includes a ring that can hold up to four of the system's SB-R200 flash units on any current Nikon lens except for most extreme telephoto and wide-angle models. The full system, which includes light stands and other small accessories, has a list price of $820. Individual flashes can be purchased for $300.
