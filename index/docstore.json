They also noted that other major Hollywood unions had issued statements condemning the attack.\nThe letter has now been signed by more than 300 writers, including Jerry Seinfeld, Eric Roth (\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d) and Amy Sherman-Palladino (\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d). Some Jewish screenwriters had begun to question whether they should remain part of an organization that they felt did not support them.\nMs. Stiehm\u2019s initial reply to the open letter was an email to inquiring members saying that the lack of response was because \u201cthe board\u2019s viewpoints are varied, and we found consensus out of reach.\u201d\nThe letter on Tuesday, which said the guild\u2019s leadership was \u201chorrified by the atrocities committed by Hamas,\u201d was an attempt to stem the outrage. \n\u201cI really appreciate this statement,\u201d said the screenwriter Howard Gordon (\u201c24\u201d and \u201cHomeland\u201d), who added in an interview that the silence from the guild had prompted responses from both Jewish and non-Jewish members ranging from rage to fear to the desire to resign from the organization.\n\u201cI hope this letter goes a long way to sort of calming some of it down,\u201d said Mr. Gordon, who signed the open letter to the guild. \u201cHopefully something constructive comes out of this, which is an acknowledgment of how we combat and confront and talk about antisemitism.\u201d\nFor Dan Gordon, however, the apology came too late. Mr. Gordon, 76, sent a letter Tuesday morning resigning his membership in the organization, calling its silence \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\u201cIt is corrosive to me as a writer and repugnant to every fiber of my being as a person of conscience,\u201d wrote Mr. Gordon, who has no relation to Howard Gordon and is best known for \u201cThe Hurricane\u201d and \u201cWyatt Earp.\u201d \u201cI am resigning my membership not because I wish to work on nonunion projects, nor cross any picket line, but because I no longer wish to be a fellow traveler with those who hide behind the fetid veil of a morally bankrupt wokeism and stand silent in the face of unadulterated evil.\u201d\nMr. Gordon\u2019s latest film, \u201cIrena\u2019s Vow\u201d \u2014 about a young Polish-Catholic woman during World War II who hid 12 Jews in the basement of a German officer\u2019s house without his knowledge for almost a year \u2014 debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival in September.\nHe will change his guild membership status to \u201cfinancial core,\u201d according to his letter. Under that designation, he will still receive the contract benefits earned by the guild but he will no longer be able to vote or attend any guild meetings.
