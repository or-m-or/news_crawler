Investors hammered shares of the Bavarian car maker BMW today, after the company's top executives gave analysts a vague and unconvincing description of their strategy for repairing Rover, the troubled British subsidiary.
BMW shares dropped more than 4 percent, to 606 euros ($565.58) from 633 euros ($590.78). The decline marked a shaky start for BMW's new chairman, Joachim Milberg, who had just made his first formal presentation to investment analysts since the ouster last month of his predecessor, Bernd Pischetsrieder.
It also signaled the depth of unease about the problems at Rover, which lost nearly $1 billion last year. The gloom appeared likely to persist even though the British Government announced late today that it would contribute an unspecified amount of money to help modernize Rover's main factory in the town of Longbridge.
Though BMW and the British Government had been haggling over the amount of financial support needed to keep the factory alive, most analysts had assumed that the two sides would reach a deal.
